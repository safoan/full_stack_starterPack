# Full_Stack_Starter_Pack 

clone and Code faster 

the idea was each time i am building a FullStck app i had to start from Scratch Since mostly 
using the same Stack i Figured out why not build a repo that will get me running fast . 

 # the_Stack
 
FrontEnd :
i went with nextjs (without the app Router ) & Tailwind Css

nextjs : (https://nextjs.org/)
tailwind : (https://tailwindcss.com/)

Backend : (my favorit) 
nodejs & express (typescript of cours ) with the ORM Prisma and the database its set to postgress 
but you can use whatever you as long its supported by wich are ( postgress /mysql / mongodb / sqlite / ...) 

Prisma : ( https://www.prisma.io/orm ) 

if you to know how i built it i will write a post about it you find link here if you intersted
